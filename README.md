### Description:
  While I was talking to people, the most common question is "Is it hard to setup NodeJS?  Do you have like structured one people can build on?"
  I figured why not put up a scaffolding project.  Just like Angular-Seed.
  This project is bare-minimal. Plus you might have to bare with me on the technologies that I choose.  lol.  So be patient. 

### Technologies:
#### Server
- NodeJS as server
- Express middleware
- Jade server templates
- LESS for CSS

#### Client
- RequireJS
- jQuery
- underscore
- bootstrap

### How to get started?
- checkout the repo.
- run ```npm install```to download all the node modules that are used in this project.
- run ```./run.sh``` to start the server.
- open a browser and visit ```http://localhost:3000/```.
